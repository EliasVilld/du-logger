# How to use
To use this library in Dual Universe, you can simply copy the lua code and paste it into a Library slot (the two classes `log.lua` and `logger.lua` have been written here in two different files just for readability). It can be used to monitor the computation time of a part of your script like this example below:
```lua

```
